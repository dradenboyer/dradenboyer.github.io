            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>A little bit about me, primarily my name is Draden Boyer. I am from the state of Utah. With that I have developed a love for the outdoors. 
                Being in the canyon or on top of mountains. Some of my hobbies include traveling, hiking, camping, fishing and all different kinds of sports, such as; football, basketball, golf, skiing, and so much more! I love being active and going to the gym to improve and better myself a little each day. 
                I've also enjoyed playing video games from a very young age. Computers always interested me.
                Taking a few Computer Programming classes during highschool to now wanting to become a full time developer. 
                Learning new things always intrigues me and keeps my mind going, with technology it seems there is constantly always something new to learn! I find problem solving and looking to others for help an enjoyable process and fun/interesting to see how others think and solve problems. </p>
